Special Features:

4. User may also import stuff from other users library by searching for other user. All necessary validations have been implemented to ensure that the correct username is being retrieved and displaying error message if the user does not exist. The intresting feature is that there is an option called "keep this private" which lets the user keep his content private and restricts other users access on it. So when a user is trying to import content, only that content would be shown to that user which has public access.
